Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods, tools for the maintaining of high quality software.
in the technology industry it has help in the improvement of maintaining of high quality software that has helped in our moderm life in the aspect of commerce,communication,even transportation.




Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Devoloping of programming languages(e.g fortran)(1960's).
Software engineering as a discipline (1970's).
Advent structure programming(1970,s).





List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
REQUIREMENTS: the requirements of the user and the systems needs.
IMPLEMENTATION: the designing, creating, coding of the software.
TESTING: the testing of the software if it meets required standard.
DEPLOYMENT: the release of the software for use.
MAINTAINING: updating, for changes.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
WATERFALL: this type of methodologies deals with a sequencial downflow of methods. -For a new sofware.
AGILE: this type of methodologies deals with the repeatation and additional methods focused on flexibility in reponse to change. For existing softwares.




Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS: this are engineers that design, code and develops the sofware.
QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEERS: this are engineers that test for the quality of a sofware.
PROJECT MANAGERS: this are engineers that plan and excute the sofware.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's: this is for the designing, debugging, creating of codes for sofware(sublime,visual code studio).
VSC: this are for the tracking of any changes that was made to the source code.(ish).



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
CHALLENGES;
change in user requirements.
limited time for the development of a software.
low quality software brings about more expenses on maintainace in the future.

Strategies To Overcome Challenges;
effective communication.
priority for tasks.
reassessing and iteration of tasks and projects.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
UNIT: this is an individual component and modules sofware testing.-to meet requirements.
INTEGRATION: this is the testing that involves between the components and subsystem.-for accuracy
SYSTEM: this is a testing that involves the sofware as a whole.-to meet the standard quality.
ACCEPTANCE: this testing involves the testing of the interface.




#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
this is an engineering that deals the set of instructions, commands, questions, given to an AI models for an accurate, best, perfect response.
IMPORTANCE;
To get accurate and best response.
seperation of instruction.
specific response.
breif structural response.




Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
VAGUE PROMPT;- what do call the worth of an iphone.
IMPROVED PROMPT;- how much is an iphone 12 in an amazon store, in dollar currency.
PROMPT IMPORTANCE;- it brings the best and exact result.
