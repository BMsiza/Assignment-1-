Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software principles.
software engineering helps in the creating of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life such as transport and logistics, healthcare, banking and finance and etc.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering are: 
(i) the development of programming languages eg Fortan,C
(ii) the establishemetn of software engineering as a discpline in the 1960s
(iii) the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

(1)Requirements - gathering user needs and documenting system requirements 
(2)Design -creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
(3)Implementation - code writng and building the software according to the software specifications
(4)Testing - conducting tests and ensuring software meets quality standards and functional requirements 
(5)Deployment - relasing the software to the customers or users
(6)Maintenance - provising ongoing support, updates, and enhancments to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodologies is a sequential approach with distinct phases eg requirements, design, implementation. flowing downwards like a waterfall. whereas agile is and iterative and incremental approach focues on flexiblity, collaboration and responding to change 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A Quality Assurance Engineer (QA), ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Intergrated Development Environments provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code eg

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenges faced by software engineers include: changing requirements, tight deadlines and technical debt. Ways thhrough which one can onversome some of these challenges are: effective communication, agile methodologies, task prioritization of taks and regular assesement of project goals and timelines. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing - testing individual components or modules of software

System testing - this testing the entire system as a whole

Intergration testing - testing interactions between diffrent components or subsystems

Acceptance testing -testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the crafting of questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 

It important in the way we interact with AI models because, it helps to make questions clear and specific so they can easily understand whatkind of information we need from them.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: How far is it?

Concise Prompt: What is the distance in kilometers from Town A to Town B through Town C.

in the concise prompt I have included the specifics in terms of distance in kilometers, starting point and ending point through an intermediate town.
