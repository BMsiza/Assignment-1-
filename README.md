#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is applying engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems that meet the needs of users.
Importance of Software Engineering: it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life such as communication, commerce, and entertainment.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
High-level Programming language1950s-1960s), Structed Programming (1970s), Agile Methodology (1990s-2000s)
1. High-Level Programming Languages (1950s-1960s):
Early software was written in machine code, which was difficult to understand and use. The development of high-level programming languages like Fortran and COBOL made it easier for programmers to write and understand code, greatly simplifying software development.
2. Structured Programming (1970s): 
As software projects became larger, the need for better organization became apparent. Structured programming introduced the use of clear, organized code structures, which made programs easier to read, understand, and maintain. This was a big step away from unstructured and confusing "spaghetti code."
3. Agile Methodologies (1990s-2000s):
Traditional software development followed a strict, step-by-step process. Agile methodologies changed this by encouraging flexibility and frequent updates. Agile focuses on working closely with customers and regularly delivering small parts of the software, allowing teams to adapt quickly to changes and improve the software over time.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements, Design, Implementing, Testing, Deployment and Maintenance 
Requirements: gather and document user needs and system requirements.
Design: create high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Write code and build the software according to specifications.
Testing: conduct various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards.
Deployment: release the software to users .
Maintenance:; Pr:ide ongoing support, update and enhancements to the software after deployment.
