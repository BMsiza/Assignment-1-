#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering simply means the various engineering principles taht are applied using a programming language to build software solutions for end user.
Importance of Software engineering include: It helps in handling of big projects, It enables reliability of software, it ensure proper utiliztion of time, it helps to reduce complexity 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  a. the development of programming languages e.g JAVA, PYTHON    
  b. the establishment of software engineering as a discipline   
  c. the advent of structured programming 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Requirement,  
  Design,  
  Implementation, 
  Testing, 
  Deployment,  
  Maintenance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Comparison:  They are both Software Development Lifecycle(SDLC) methodologies that have been widely accepted in the IT industry.
  Contrast:  Waterfall adopts a linear and sequential approach where each project phase must be completed before the next one begins while Agile operates on iterative progress through      small, manageable units of work 
  Agile is appropriate for ongoing projects and projects where certain details are not known from the outset. 
  Waterfall is appropriate for projects that do not have complicated requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  Software Developer is the person that write the codes and implement software solutions.
  Quality Assurance Engineer: This is the professional that ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  Project Manager is responsible for overseeing  the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
  
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):  It is a software application that helps programmers with comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Examples: Sublime, VSCode, Eclipse, PyCharm. 
Version Control Systems (VCS): It is used tools for tracking changes to source code and collaboration among team members. Examples AWS CodeCommit, GIT, Mercurial, Bitbucket


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays. Solutio: effective communication 
  Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality. Solution: regular reassessment of project goals and         timelines.
  Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs. Solution: Prioritization of task


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  a.  Unit Testing: It is the first level of functional test - It is used to ensure that individual parts of an application work.
  b.  Integration Testing: The different units, modules or components of a software application are tested as a combined entity.
  c.  System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  d. Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to creating precise and effective prompts to get context-driven AI outputs from large language models.
Importance of prompt engineering: a. It saves time as communication is needed to achieve the desired result   b. It gives more control to get predictable responses from the AI  c. Less ambiguity is experienced.   


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
