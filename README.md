Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process designing,building, testing and implementing software in a structured way.
its importance to the technology industry is it gives clients the privilege of getting better software,scalability such you can grow your systems. it saves on money and time.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
discovery stage. this is when it has been discovered and you start brain storming ideas.
birth of software engineering. this is when the design ,requirement gathering has commissioned.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

planning in this face you identify the goals ,requirements and scopes. you estimate the time,resources to use.
requirement analysis. you gather all the user needs. you gather your feasibility study that is technically, operational and financial.

design. determine the model to use,the system architecture and the workflow.
coding. the developer begins to code by their desired language and coding environment.
Testing.this is where you release the software to the users. you van either use phase testing ,pilot testing. you test is the software meets the goals.
deployment. release it to the actual user. install it on servers or computers.
documentation. this is where you document everything so that just incase something happens someone else can understand the system.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall method follows stages where by one phase has to be completed for you to go to the next phase example banking system security and functionality are tested before being released it planned where as the agile method it can be done in short cycles and the next cycle does not depend on the previous one.example like moblie app development developers release updates depending on usee needs they tackle the recent problem and release others later.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a software developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a project manager in a software engineering team.
software developer their role is to develop, design, and build software. maintain the system and create updates.
quality assurance engineer, this professional makes sure that the software meets the standards of quality assurance set. 
project manager he/she is responsible for ensuring that the project is using the allocated resources well and all milestones agreed are met.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
integrated development environment, and this environments enable developers to create,edit, and test codes. An example of a visual studio is an IDE where as version control systems help developers track changes and updates to their code. example Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
limited resources. strategy to solve that is that it has open source platforms that enable developers to access the resources when required.
limited knowledge and exposure to upcoming technologies. this can be overcome by having platforms that share information for free to create accessibility.
time consuming to create software and debugging. this can be overcome by integrating software engineering with AI to enable easier debugging and coding.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing this is testing a single alone to ensure it works well alone while it's not part of the entire system.its importance is that you can detect the problem easily and locate it.
integration testing is testing if all units can be enhanced to perform better and how far it can integrate to.it helps to measure the threshold of your system.
system testing is testing if the system meets the goals that it is met for.
acceptance testing is checking to see how the software is accepted by the users according to software quality assurance . its importance is to make sure that the software is well accepted and functioning according to the users.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is designing and refining prompts to help users communicate better with AI models.
importance:
Better AI response this prompts enable to get better response from the model.
creativity and innovation.
efficiency.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt. tell me about technology.
improved prompt. how does artificial intelligence inpact the banking system.
the improved one helps the model to do its research focusing on a certain direction.instead of a vast pool of information.
