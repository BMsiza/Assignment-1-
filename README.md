Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. 
It's importance is that it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-The development of high-level programming languages such as Fortran in 1957 and COBOL in 1959 marked a significant shift from machine and assembly languages to more abstract and human-readable languages. It made it possible to write complex programs that could easily be understood, maintained and transferred across different machines.
-Introduction of structured programming which was meant to improve clarity, quality and development time of software by emphasizing the use of clear and well-defined control structures and modular design. It helped reduce errors and made programs easier to debug, maintain and modify.
-Introduction of object-oriented programming which includes languages like C++ in 1983 and Java in 1995. It introduced the concept of organizing software design around objects and it promoted modularity, flexibility and maintainability.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Planning- involved defining the project's purpose and the desired result and by the end of this phase, each team member must understand their roles and tasks.
- Requirements - the project lead analyzes the product or client's goals and decides on the features to aim for as a final goal. Defining and establishing requirements determines what the application will do once launched, the necessary components, and the resources needed to launch it.
- Design and Prototype - the design phase defines how a software application will work and here the teams decide on the programming language, screen layouts, and the relevant documentation that they will use. A prototype is also made in this phase and it is a basic idea of how the application looks and works.
- Software development- the developers start programming in this phase and build the entire system thereby shaping the project. This should be done after they have established clear predefined guidelines to ensure the code's quality.
- Testing- this happens in parallel with development, as developers write and test the code they've produced before moving on to the next coding task. The tests include code quality, unit testing, integration testing, performance testing and security testing.
- Deployment- this process starts once the testing phase is over and there are no bugs or errors in the development backlog.
- Maintenance- here bugs and errors that were missed during testing and are bound to appear are checked. By studying user behaviour and feedback, the team can start to think about and plan for upgrades.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Agile is flexible and iterative, emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation while Waterfall is sequential and rigid, with distinct phases completed in order.
- Agile promotes ongoing collaboration, while Waterfall focuses on thorough planning and execution in predetermined stages.
- Waterfall model is appropriate for projects with well-established requirements, and changes mid-course are discouraged.
- The Agile model is appropriate where change should be easily embraced and with regular retrospectives and feedback loops enabling ongoing improvement and strategy refinement.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software developer- are responsible for designing, coding and implementing software applications. Their responsibilities include coding, designing, debugging and testing.
- Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures that the software meets the required quality standards before it is released to users. Their responsibilities include test planning, automation and bug reporting.
- Project Manager - is responsible for overseeing the entire software development process, ensuring that the project is completed on time, within budget and to the required quality standards. Their responsibilities include planning, resource management, risk management and ensuring successful project delivery.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDEs help programmers develop software code efficiently. They increase  developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. Examples are Visual Studio Code and Pycharm.
- VCS  streamline development processes, enabling faster iteration and delivery of features. Examples are Git and Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Lack of Workflow Visibility- A lot of development teams suffer because of a vague understanding of the engineering processes within their organization. This can be combated by project managers estimating timelines that are evidence-based and feasible. Engineering managers can evenly allocate work to software engineers based on individual capacity, workload, and expertise.
- Broken SDLC Processes - this include poor requirement gathering , improper code reviews etc. This can be combated by using an engineering management platform to analyze higher PR reviews, and PR ratio, and identify optimal review workload for your team.
- Scalability, Security, and Performance Challenges- A software application must always be designed for scalability, security, and usability. However, different engineers have different expertise and coding styles, for example, some donâ€™t comment on their code enough, and some comment excessively. This can be combated by defining coding standards to write scalable code and using security testing tools & platforms for enhanced security.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit testing- it verifies that software components perform as designed. This level is important for ensuring the reliability and functionality of the smallest parts of an application. Unit testing can also help minimize the time and resources needed for testing, bug fixing, and maintenance.
- Integration testing - it  combines units within a program and tests them as a group. This level helps find interface defects between modules and functions, and determines how efficiently the units are running together.
- System testing - it examines both functional and non-functional testing requirements. It helps identify and fix bugs and errors in software applications.
- Acceptance testing - it verifies that the requirements have been met. It confirms the software's stability and checks for flaws.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering involves creating prompts that lead to high quality promps from the language model. It is about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from your robot and AI assistant.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- An example of vague prompt would be "Give me information on Jamaica". This could be improved by saying "Give me detailed information on the best tourist spots and hotels in Jamaica. Add relevant details on how safe the cities are and important cultural information I should know before going there." The latter prompt is more effective as it is clear and specific, hence helping the language model give you the best answer quickly.
