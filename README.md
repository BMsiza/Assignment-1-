#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of developing solutions to current world problems using computer technologies based on principles, processes and tools where the end result is a software.
It plays an important role in technology industry as it creates software applications and systems that facilitate various aspects of human life such as communication and health care.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The key milestones in evolution of software engineering are
a)Development of programming languages such as forecan 
b)Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s.
c)Advent of structured programming in 1970s.
d)Rise od agile methodologies in 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements- Involves gathering and user needs and system requirements.
2.Design-Create high level and detailed design of the software and Internet.
3.Impelentation-Entails writing a code and building the software according to design specifications.
4.Testing-Conduct various tests to ensure software meets quality and functional standards.
5.Deployment-The software is released to users.
6.Maintanance-Involves providing ongoing support,updates and enhancing software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfall uses linear and sequential process which Agile uses iterative and incremental process where project is divided into sprints.
2. Waterfall is rigid leaving little or no room for adjustment once a phase is completed while Agile is flexible and allows for ongoing changes to be made.
3. In Waterfall feedback is collected after a project is fully developed while for Agile feedback is provided continously hence quick adaptability to change.
4. Waterfall delivers a single final product while Agile delivers frequent incremental updates.
   examples of scenarios where Waterfall is used include construction projects and hardware manufacturing
   examples of scenarios where Agile is used include software development such as mobile app and marketing campaigns.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer-Writes the code and implement software solutions.
Quality Assurance engineer-Ensures software quality by designing and executing the test plan.
Project manager-Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software project  

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Importance of IDEs inculde:-
1.Provides a comprehensive environment that combines various tools needed for software development.
2.Help developers write cleaner and more accurate code reducing the likelihood of bugs.
3.Integrated debuggers in IDEs allow developers to step through code, inspect variables, and understand the flow of execution.
4.Many IDEs allow customization through plugins and extensions, enabling developers to tailor the environment to their specific needs hence enhancing productivity.
Examples of IDEs inculde Visual Studio code and IntelliJ IDEA.
Importance of Version Control Systems 
1.It maintains a history of all changes made to the codebase hence reducing risk of data loss.
2.It also allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other’s change allowing collaboration between team members in software development.
3.VCS supports branching hence developers can work on different features or bug fixes in isolated environments ensuring main codebase remains stable.
4.VCS records who made each change and why, creating a transparent history of the project’s evolution hence enhancing accountability  
Examples of Version Control Systems include Git and Subversion 
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Changing requirements which leads to project delays or scrapping off of the project. The solution here would be use of Agile methodology which is very flexible.
2. Tight deadlines to be met which may lead to rushed development and poor quality output. Solution here may be to prioritise tasks to help in time amd resource allocation.
3.Technical debt arising from shortcuts that may hinder future developments efforts and maintainance.Maybe solved by effective communication and regular assessment of project goals and timelines


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is individual testing of nodules in a software. 
Integration testing is done on interactions between different components in a system. 
System testing is test done on the whole software  
Acceptance testing is where software is tested against user needs to ensure they are met.
Their importance in quality assurance is that it helps detect and fix defects earlier in development stages leading to high quality software product.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is crafting of questions to get best possible responses from AI models. 
It makes questions specific and clear so that AI can understand what one exactly wants avoiding getting confusing answers  

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague:How to practice animal farming 
Clear:How to practice cattle farming in the rift Valley region of Kenya 
 The improved prompt is more effective because as a user I get the specific information I want with is clear rather than the vague which is so general
