#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The evolution of software engineering has been marked by several key milestones that have shaped the discipline. Here are three significant ones:

1. **The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)**:
   The term "software engineering" was popularized during the NATO Software Engineering Conference held in Garmisch, Germany. This event highlighted the growing complexity of software systems and the need for a more structured approach to software development. The conference emphasized the importance of applying engineering principles to software development to improve reliability, maintainability, and productivity.

2. **The Introduction of the Waterfall Model (1970)**:
   In 1970, Herbert D. Dijkstra and others proposed the Waterfall model, which became one of the first formalized models of software development. This model introduced a linear, sequential approach to software development, consisting of distinct phases: requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance. While it has been criticized for its rigidity, the Waterfall model laid the groundwork for many future methodologies and highlighted the importance of clear documentation and phase transitions.

3. **Agile Methodology (2001)**:
   The Agile Manifesto was published in 2001 by a group of software developers seeking to promote a more flexible and iterative approach to software development. Agile methodologies prioritize customer collaboration, responsiveness to change, and the delivery of functional software in short cycles. This shift marked a significant departure from traditional models like Waterfall and introduced practices such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), which are widely adopted in the industry today.

These milestones reflect the ongoing evolution of software engineering as a discipline, emphasizing the need for adaptability, structured processes, and a focus on collaboration and customer needs.
 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
