# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

## Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

> Software engineering is the process of designing, building, and maintaining high quality software.
>
> It is important because it is the backbone of modern communication, commerce and most day-to-day activities.

-----

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

- Development of programming languages like C, JavaScript and Python
- Software engineering as a field of study and career choice
- Introduction of programming structures and methodologies

-----

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

- Planning: This involves gathering requirements, use cases and potential trade-offs.
- Design: This involves creating designs and visual maps of the architechture and UI.
- Development: The process of translating design into software with code.
- Testing: Making the software reliable by fixing bugs and ensuring everything works as intended.
- Deployment: Making the software accessible to end-users.
- Maintenance: A continued cycle of fixing bugs, provifing updates and support, as well as adding/removing features.

-----

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

> **Waterfall**: Waterfall is linear and involves sequential stages. Like following a recipe, each stage has to be completed one after the other. It is rigid and suitable for scenarios where requirements are clear from the start. Example: building a bridge.
> 
> **Agile**: This methodology is an incremental and collaborative model. It is flexible and allows evolving requirements. Example: building an AI todo list.

-----

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- Software Developer: writing code, debugging, implementing solutions
- QA Engineer: tests software to find and fix bugs, ensures reliability
- Project Manager: responsible for planning, product vision and gathering requirements

-----

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

- IDEs provide code editors, debuggers, and compilers in one place which streamline coding and boosts productivity. Examples: Visual Studio, Webstorm, Zed
- VCSs track changes to code and allow developers to collaborate and manage versions. Examples: Git, Subversion

-----

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

- Problems:
    - Tight deadlines
    - Technical debt
    - Bugs and complex issues
    - Changing requirements
    - Miscommunication
- Solutions:
    - Break tasks into smaller parts and prioritize
    - Regular refactors should be considered as important as new features
    - Learn to use debuggers, write clear code, write tests
    - Define clear requirements and manage expectations
    - Use clear documentations, hold regular meetings

-----

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

- Unit tests:
    - testing individual components/modules
    - ensures each component/module works correctly independently
- Integration tests:
    - testing interaction between components/modules
    - ensures combined parts work together as expected 
- System tests:
    - tests the software system as a whole
    - ensures the software meets requirements, functionality and performance 
- Acceptance tests:
    - tests the software against user requirements
    - ensures the software meets user needs and is ready for deployment


## Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

> Prompt engineering is crafting and refining prompts to effectively communicate with AI models.
>
> The goal is to help shape the behavior of the AI model to be more reliable, accurate and efficient.

-----

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

- Vague: "How to optimize profile"
- Improved: "Give me a step-by-step guide on how to optmize my LinkedIn profile for recruiters and maximum visibility"
- The improved prompt is more effective because
  - it mentions the profile to optimize: LinkedIn
  - highlights what to optimize for: visibility and recruiters
  - asks for actionable input: a step-by-step guide
