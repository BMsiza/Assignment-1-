#Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Waterfall Methodology : 
   >> Winston Royce introduced the Waterfall model, a linear and sequential approach to software development. This marked the beginning of structured software development, emphasizing planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. The Waterfall model laid the foundation for subsequent methodologies.

2. Agile Manifesto : 
   >> The Agile Manifesto revolutionized software development by prioritizing flexibility, collaboration, and rapid delivery. Agile introduced iterative and incremental development, empowering teams to respond to change and deliver working software in short cycles. This paradigm shift transformed the industry, enabling faster time-to-market and improved responsiveness to customer needs.

3. DevOps and (CI/CD) : 
   >>The emergence of DevOps and CI/CD marked a significant shift toward automation, integration, and continuous improvement. DevOps bridged the gap between development and operations teams, while CI/CD enabled automated testing, building, and deployment. This milestone has enabled faster release cycles, improved quality, and increased efficiency

#List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

   >> Planning: Define project scope, goals, timelines, budget, and resources. Identify stakeholders and their requirements.
   >> Requirements Gathering: Collect and document detailed requirements through stakeholder interviews, surveys, and analysis.
   >> Analysis : Break down requirements into smaller components, identify potential issues, and create a detailed specification.
   >> Design : Create a detailed design of the software architecture, user interface, and system components.
   >> Implementation Coding : Develop the software according to the design specifications.
   >> Testing: Verify the software meets requirements through various testing methods (unit, integration, system, acceptance).
   >> Deployment: Release the software to production, configure environments, and train users.
   >> Maintenance: Provide ongoing support, fix defects, and implement updates and enhancements.
   >> Evaluation: Assess the software's performance, gather feedback, and identify areas for improvement.
